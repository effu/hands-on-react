# LIFECYCLE METHODS

Alternates to event handlers that are called in components. Here are the lifecycle methods:

* componentWillMount
* componentDidMount
* componentWillUnmount
* componentWillUpdate
* componentDidUpdate
* shouldComponentUpdate
* componentWillReceiveProps
* componentDidCatch

render() is not a lifecycle method but used just as frequently.
